	After getting inspired to take up some sort of digitaal art, as well as considering I had experience with poster design already and wanted totry a diferent style, I had bought myself my first drawing tablet (the Huion H960P in case anyone's interested). In order to practice using it, I had decided to do some sort of project based work with deadlines. I had decided to also focus on Environment and Prop Design as that was what iintrigued me most at the time. <br>
	After some consideration, I realized that there where eight months left in the year and so I decided to set myself the goal of creating at least one Environment (and maybe prop) -focused piece every month for the last eight months of the year, hence Environment Eight.
