	Not including January, there are 48 weeks in the year. Incidentally, the most amount of successive free-time hours I have is during the weekend totalling aproximately two days, or 48 hours. because of this, as well as partially inspired by the weekend-long <a href="http://https://globalgamejam.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Game Jam</a> event, I decided to do my own form of Art Jam with the challange of making at least one illustration piece per weekend. <br>
	Unlike Environment Eight, however, this was not limited to environment art, but also included things such as logos, posers and prop desighn.
