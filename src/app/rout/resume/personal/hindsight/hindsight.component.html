	Having specificallly focused on 2D-Arts-related projects as the focus of my last few projects, I have decided to go "back to my roots", in a manner of speaking, and combine all of my skills into a year-long Game Development project.<br>
	Initially, I was considering this project to be on a "skill a month" basis - where I would spend each mounth practicing a topic such as sketching or game design, for instance - but having started the first month with game design I soon got invested in the game idea and instead decided to evolve it and work on it for an end of year release.
