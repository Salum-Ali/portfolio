<p>
	In order to not get rusty on any of my skills, as well being able to explore new things easily, I like to do regular personal projects, often focusing on different topics and skills.
	<!-- Although I may often do year-long projects as a sort of "Resolutiion" for the year, some personal projects can be specific to certain time periods for various reasons. -->
