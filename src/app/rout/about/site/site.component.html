	It all started as a simple HTML-based project. <br>
	Interestingly, although the visual layout hasn't really changed much,
	the methods of doing various tasks has. <br><br>
	For example,
	the site went from being simply HTML/CSS based to HTML and <b>S</b>CSS/<b>SASS</b> based. <br><br>
	Additionally, this has evolved with my introduction to Angular JS, and now some JavaScript elements are being
	experimented with.
