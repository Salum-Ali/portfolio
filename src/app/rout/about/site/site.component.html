	It all started as a simple HTML-based project. <br>
	Interestingly, although the visual layout hasn't really changed much,
	the methods of doing various tasks has.<br>
	For example,
	the site went from being simply HTML/CSS based to HTML and <b>S</b>CSS/<b>SASS</b> based. Additionally, this has evolved with my introduction to Angular JS, and now some JavaScript elements are being
	experimented with in order to take more advantage of Angular's dynamic features and nature.

	At some points in time, I may open myself up to commissions and/or open a shop section for various things.<br>
	From time to time, such as when commissions or the shop are closed, some or all of the "shopping" pages may have dissabled links.<br>
	This, I've found, is a lot less confusing compared to dissabling the "shopping" buttonn entirely. This is because dissabled sub-menu links are greyed out while there's no difference to the main navigation bar options.
