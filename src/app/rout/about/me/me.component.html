<h1>
	Hi there!
</h1>

<p>
	Thank you very much for exploring my Portfolio Website! <br>
	As you may have noticed by the site's Blurb, I think of myself as a "Creative 'Semi-Intermediate'" in most of my skills. A slightly more specific breakdown of skills would be: <br><br>
	Digital Arts & Animation - Semi-Novice:<br>
	I use Blender for my 3D work, but I’ve used trial versions of 3DS Max & Maya.<br>
	I also took Design & Communication Graphics during my Leaving Certificate years, followig on from Technical Graphics
	in my Junior Cert course.<br>
	After discovering Krita, I’ve taken more of an interest in a painterly approach to art rather than what I’d
	call a more photo-edited method.<br>
	I seek to improve my skills in the hopes of possibly getting into different types of Illustration and Design fields.
	<br><br>
  
	Web, Game & Other App Development - Semi-Intermediate: <br>
	In creating a website mainly for a Portfolio & other works, I’ve learnt about various languages. I’ve also got
	a bit of experience with coding in Java on Object-Oriented Programming assignments. I was introduced to the
	“TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform” known as Angular after wanting a way to easily
	shift between sections of my web design project. After discovering the advantages of SASS, I'm learning that as well.
	<br>
	In secondary school, I took part in the Business Enterprise Awards event with classmates (at the time I wasn’t
	very comfortable with the marketing side, so I asked for help). After this, I decided a career in the Game
	Development industry was interesting and so my journey began.

	Thanks for reading & Regards, <br><br>
