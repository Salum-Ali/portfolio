	Hi there!
</h1>

<p>
	Thank you very much for exploring my Portfolio Website!<br><br>

	My Name is Salum Muhammed and, as you may have noticed, I like to think of myself as a "Creative Semi Intermediate" in terms of average skill level.<br>
	This is a phrase which here means that, although I may not have a <i>formal</i> education in most of my skills (being self-taught and all), I do believe that I am capable of doing or relatively-easilly learning most things and improving as time goes on.<br>
	A slightly more specific breakdown of skills would be: <br><br>

	<!-- Skill: General Game Development - Semi-Novice. <br>
	Program(s) & Tool(s): GameMaker Studio, RPG Maker, Unity, Unreal Engine. <br>
	Blurb: In secondary school, I took part in the Business Enterprise Awards event with classmates (I wasnâ€™t very comfortable with the marketing side which, sidenote, partially inspired me taking a BA in Digital Marketing eventually, so I asked for help). After this, I decided a career in the Game Development industry was interesting and so my journey began. <br><br> -->
